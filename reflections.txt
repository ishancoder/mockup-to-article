You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
* I'm pretty familiar with HTML so the only thing I have learnt is <sup> and <del> tags.
* Everything in this particular project is pretty straight forward and Easy.
* Nothing is difficult.
* First of all I have broken down the whole article in parts and tried to solve one thing at a time.
  1. I figured out which section goes in the paragraph.
  2. I have added the anchor tags for links and <img> tags.
  3. Added the <em> and <strong> tags.
  4. I have looked for ways to strike through text and superscript them and found <del> and <sup> tags.
  5. Finally I have added <del> and <sup> tags.
